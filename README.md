# grapevine_stomatal_traits
A study that uses the functional-structural plant model HydroShoot [(Albasha et al., 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1093/insilicoplants/diz007) to explore stomatal traits to mitigate heat effects by [Albasha et al. (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192324000078#sec0015).

This code, which serves at launching HydroShoot simulations, along with the analysis scripts, is embedded in [`https://github.com/MB3579/Albasha_Bartlett_AgForestMeteo_2024`](https://github.com/MB3579/Albasha_Bartlett_AgForestMeteo_2024). The latter repo was used to produce the results reported by [Albasha et al. (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192324000078#sec0015).
