# grapevine_stomatal_traits
Study using HydroShoot to explore interesting stomatal traits to mitigate increasing temperature effects by [Albasha et al. (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192324000078#sec0015).

**This code was used to perform grapevine gas and energy exchange simulations using the functional-structural plant model HydroShoot (Albasha et al., 2019). The code is embedded with analysis scripts in [`https://github.com/MB3579/Albasha_Bartlett_AgForestMeteo_2024`](https://github.com/MB3579/Albasha_Bartlett_AgForestMeteo_2024).
